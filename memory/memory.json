Please respond with \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nHere is a brief summary:\n\n1. Number of Susceptible individuals at the end of the simulation.\n2. Number of Infected individuals at the end of the simulation.\n3. Number of Recovered individuals at the end of the simulation.\n4. The total number of simulations run.\n5. The average number of new infected cases per day (R_t) during the simulation period.\n6. Visualizations to help interpret the data and trends over time.\n\nIf you choose to analyze the results, I'll provide you with more detailed information for each of these points. Let me know if you're interested!",

This maximum infection occurred at one of the timesteps within the 250 total rows in the data, but the specific timestep is not provided in the summary.\n\nOn average, there were approximately 261.96 infected individuals across the 250 timesteps and 50 simulation runs. The dataset also shows that a total of 24,412 individuals recovered from the simulated epidemic. Lastly, the average number of susceptible individuals throughout the simulation was around 461.85."
