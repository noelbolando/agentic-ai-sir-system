If so, we can provide you with visualizations and statistics about the spread of the disease, such as the final number of infected individuals, the reproduction number (R0), and the duration of the outbreak.\"\n\nYou could also ask the user if they'd prefer any specific visualization or analysis method. For example: \"Would you like to see a graph showing the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals over time? Or perhaps you're interested in seeing how different parameters affect the spread of the disease?\"\n\nBy offering multiple options, you can tailor the analysis to the user's needs and ensure they have a satisfying experience with your model.",

This maximum infection occurred at one of the timesteps within the 250 total rows in the data, but the specific timestep is not provided in the summary.\n\nOn average, there were approximately 261.96 infected individuals across the 250 timesteps and 50 simulation runs. The dataset also shows that a total of 24,412 individuals recovered from the simulated epidemic. Lastly, the average number of susceptible individuals throughout the simulation was around 461.85."
