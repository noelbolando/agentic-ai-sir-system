run_id: "Unique ID for each simulation run."
step: "The time step within each simulation run."
agent_id: "The unique ID of an agent with an associated infection state at each time step. Agent IDs remain unchanged for each simulation run."
state: "The infection state of an agent for each time step."
infector_agent_id: "Unique ID of the agent that transmitted the infection to another agent."
infector_group_id: "Group ID of the group that the infector was in during the time step that transmission occured."
infected_agent_id: "ID of the agent who got infected by another agent."
infected_agent_group: "Group ID of the group where the infected agent contracted the infection."
lapsed_infection_time: "Time duration since the infector agent was infected. This tells us how long infector agents have been infected."
num_susceptible: "The number of susceptible agents at a given time step."
num_infected: "The number of infected agents at a given time step."
num_recovered: "The number of recovered agents at a given time step."
