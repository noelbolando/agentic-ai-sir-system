# Agentic-AI System for SIR Infectious Disease Models #

This repo contains all the agent files and database protocols necessary to support a multi-agentic AI system for running, analyzing, and querying an Agent-Based infectious disease model.

This system employs six AI agents which help users to interact with an infectious disease model, tune model parameters, analyze results, and query scenarios. 

The following diagram outlines this Agentic AI system:
