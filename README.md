# Agentic-AI System for SIR Infectious Disease Models #

This repo contains all the agent files and database protocols necessary to support a multi-agentic AI system for running, analyzing, and querying an Agent-Based infectious disease model.

This system employs six AI agents which help users to interact with an infectious disease model, tune model parameters, analyze results, and query scenarios.
